# EventFlex 🎉

``` EventFlex is a smart event management and staffing platform designed to streamline how hosts, organizers, and gig workers collaborate. Built during our college hackathon, it integrates backend services, blockchain verification, and scalable architecture to ensure trust, compliance, and efficiency in event workflows ```

# 🚀 Project Overview

- Hackathon Milestone: By November 5, we completed the backend, frontend, and blockchain modules for the hackathon submission.
